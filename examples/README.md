# Hydrogen examples

The example apps in this directory show how to implement popular design patterns in Hydrogen.

Each example is a complete Hydrogen app, based on Hydrogen’s [Skeleton template](/templates/skeleton/), that you can inspect and run locally. See each example's README file for details on the problem it solves, how the solution works, and any other requirements you’ll need.

Examples are kept intentionally minimal, containing only the new and updated code required to illustrate a working use case.

## Popular examples
