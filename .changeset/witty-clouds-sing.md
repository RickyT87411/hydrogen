'@shopify/cli-hydrogen': patch

`init` command can link an existing storefront on Admin when creating a storefront from the CLI.

After logging into your Shop, the CLI will let you choose if you wish to create a new storefront on Admin or link an existing one. `npm create @shopify/hydrogen` command will also benefit from this change.
