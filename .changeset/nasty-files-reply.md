'@shopify/cli-hydrogen': patch
---

Add experimental support for Vite projects.

To test this unstable feature, make sure you're running the latest version of the Hydrogen CLI, then run `npx shopify hydrogen setup vite` in your Hydrogen project. This command edits existing files and creates some new ones required to run Vite.

Please report [any issues you run into](https://github.com/Shopify/hydrogen/issues/new?assignees=&labels=bug%3Aunverified&projects=&template=bug_report.yml), and let us know if you have any feedback or suggestions.
