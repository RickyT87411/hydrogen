Remove hidden attribute from `deploy` command

You can now deploy your Hydrogen storefront without connecting to GitHub. Run the `deploy` command from your local terminal or configure a CI/CD (e.g. Bitbucket) for continuous deployment.

Run `h2 deploy --help` to see additional features of the command.
