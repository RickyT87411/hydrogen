'@shopify/hydrogen': patch
---

Add a `<Pagination__unstable>` component and `getPaginationVariables__unstable` helper to make rendering large lists from the Storefront API easy. This is an initial unstable release and we expect to finalize the API by the 2023-07 release. See the [`<Pagination>` component documentation](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/hydrogen/2023-04/components/pagination).
